        The brand focuses on the analysis of the relationship between objects and people. This
        intangible affection, this synergy between object and subject as a process of mutual
        becoming is the core of the brand research.Nurturing a new definition of materialism based
        on emotions and affect.
      </p>
      <p class="philo-text">
        The aim is to create outcomes that can be treasured and are a constant reminder of the story
        that is behind them. The shortened product lifecycle can be tackled using this approach to
        promote durability.
      </p>
      <p class="philo-text">
        Craftsmanship and Italian tradition are at the centre of the brand values and combined with
        constant research of materials and new techniques to create luxury products that set aside
        from the fast pace of today’s fashion system.
      </p>
      <p class="philo-text">
        The brand researches new perspectives to reinvent people’s closet, changing our attitude
        towards the choice of garments we have to wear everyday. Being a result of the relationship
        we have to each garment and the feeling we experience wearing them.
