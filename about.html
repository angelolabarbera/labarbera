      <h2 class="philosophy-title">The Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="philo-text">The brand focuses on the analysis of the relationship between objects and people. This intangible
          affection, this synergy between object and subject as a process of mutual becoming is the core of the
          brand research.
          Nurturing a new definition of materialism based on emotions and affect. The aim is to create outcomes
          that can be treasured and are a constant reminder of the story that is behind them.
          The shortened product lifecycle can be tackled using this approach to promote durability.
          Craftsmanship and Italian tradition are at the centre of the brand values and combined with constant
          research of materials and new techniques to create luxury products that set aside from the fast pace of
          today’s fashion system.
          The brand researches new perspectives to reinvent people’s closet, changing our attitude towards the
          choice of garments we have to wear everyday. Being a result of the relationship we have to each
          garment and the feeling we experience wearing them.</p>
